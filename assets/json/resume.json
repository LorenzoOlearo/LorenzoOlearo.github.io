The project aims at the development of a system that can predict multidimensional poverty of older people from unlabelled categorical data.

The re- search involved a deep study of the state-of-the-art in signal and speech processing as well as comprehensive review of the current deep learning approaches and architectures. Five temporal aggregators have been analyzed: TAP, GSP, SAP, ASP, and VLAD. Results show that attention- based aggregators perform better than the counterparts. Furthermore, parameterless aggrega- tors show poorer ability to generalize on long utterances.","highlights":["Sound Processing","Speaker Verification","Deep Learning"]},{"name":"32Connect.net","position":"C Programmer","startDate":"2021-3","endDate":"2021-6","summary":"I worked as a C programmer for Linux systems, I coded from the first line of the main a multi-threaded service that queries a remote sockets generating XML and Json files that will later be processed by other higher level applications.","highlights":["C","Linux","Socket Programming"]}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"unixMiB - University of Milano-Bicocca","location":"Milano, Italy","position":"Chairman","startDate":"2022-10","endDate":"current","summary":"I am responsible for coordinating with other committee members, assigning tasks and ensuring that extensive preparations are made to ensure the success of the events and talks.
