I am a student in the final stages of his Master's degree in Computer Science at
the University of Milano-Bicocca with expected graduation in October 2024 with
top marks. Currently under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi, I am working
on my thesis aimed at investigating the spatial behavior of Diffusion Models
(DMs). My journey through this program has solidified my passion for academic
research and my desire to contribute in the field of Generative Image Synthesis.


## Past Research Experience
I focused my Bachelor's on studying the theoretical and practical aspects of
Signal and Image Processing ending with a thesis on the topic of Speech
Recognition through Deep Learning. At the time I was fascinated by the idea of
working with spectrograms and the problem of correctly framing a time varying
signal. The findings of my thesis were later published in a paper presented at
ICEE Berlin 2022.

I later followed my studies with a Master's degree in which I moved towards the
fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. During this time, I won a
research grant under Prof. Francesca Gasparini to develop a novel data analysis
framework in a categorical and multidimensional setting. 
The results of this work were published and presented by me at the 
[AIxAS 2023 workshop](http://aixas.it/). 
Furthemore, this work was later selected for an extension and publication in the 
[Journal "Intelligenza Artificiale"](https://www.iospress.com/catalog/journals/intelligenza-artificiale)
and as of writing this, the manuscript has been accepted and it is now waiting
to be published in the next issue.

Although in different fields, thanks to the projects I have been involved during
my degrees I have gained practical experience with the world of academic
research. These experiences spiked my interest for the research world led me to
pursue my studies with a PhD.


## Research Statement
I am fascinated by the field of Generative Image Synthesis. I really find the
idea of creating images out of nothing but a thought to be quite incredible.

I first started working in this field during my Master's thesis, the aim of this
research is to explore how the spatial information is constructed during the
synthesis of an image in a diffusion pipeline.

My research first began by investigating the topic of conceptual and spatial
blending with DMs. This initial work allowed me to gain familiarity with DMs,
understanding their implementation and mathematical principles. Furthermore, the
findings of this allowed us to gain valuable insights into how to semantic is
spatially contructed during the synthesis of an image. The results of this
initial work were submitted and accepted at the 
[EKAPI 2024 workshop](https://sites.google.com/unical.it/ekapi-2024/home).

I am now planning to move forward with my thesis by exploring novel ways to
spatially condition the generation of an image. I think one of the biggest
limitations of current DMs is the lack of control over the spatial information,
users often end up running multiple times the same model until satisfied with
the compotition of its output; this poses a huge computational cost and it is
not sustainable in the long run. I am interested in exploring how to make
generative models more controllable and interpretable, especially in the context
of image synthesis where I believe much work is still to be done.

Making DMs completely controllable is a challenging task due to their high
dependency on the initial noise. I am currently working on understanding how to
overcome this limitation by understanding how the seed affects the spatial
composition of the output. Once DMs are fully controllable, I believe they can
be used in a wide range of applications, from reconstructing the optical flow
and depth of a scene for Autonomous Driving, reconstructing the geometry of a
scene like in NeRF or even in the field of medical imaging. These and many more
are topics that really fascinate me and on which I would like to focus during my
PhD.
