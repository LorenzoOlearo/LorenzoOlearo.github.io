Welcome to my personal website! I am Lorenzo Olearo, a PhD student in Computer
Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

I'm PhD student in computer science with a focus on generative image synthesis,
specializing in diffusion models and flow matching architectures for
controllable and high-fidelity image generation. 

I'm currently working under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi to extend my
Master's thesis work on blending diffusion models. Are you interested in these
topics and would like to know more about my work? Check out my latest blog post
on [Blending Diffusion Models](/blog/2024/blending-diffusion-models/)!

If you are interested in my work and would like to contact me, please do so
through any of the contacts at the bottom of this page. You can also find my CV
under the [CV](/cv) or learn more about my research interests and background on
the [About](/about) page.
