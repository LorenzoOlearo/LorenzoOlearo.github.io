Welcome to my personal website! I am Lorenzo Olearo, a PhD student in Computer
Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

I'm currently working with Prof. Simone Melzi focusing both on generative image
synthesis with Diffusion Models and novel geometric representations via Flow
Matching.

You can check out my [publications](/publications) to see what I've been up to,
If you are interested in my work you can reach me through any of the contacts at
the bottom of this page.

In my free time I really enjoy taking pictures of interesting things I see,
mainly on film. I follow the entire process from the shooting to the development
and finally even some printing in my own darkroom. Lately I began studying
camera repair which is not only rewarding and fun but also a great escape from a
computer screen.
