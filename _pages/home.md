I am a student in the final stages of his Master's degree in Computer Science at
the University of Milano-Bicocca with expected graduation in October 2024.
Currently under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi, I am working on my thesis
aimed at investigating the spatial behavior of Diffusion Models (DMs). My
journey through this program has solidified my passion for academic research and
my desire to contribute in the field of Generative Image Synthesis. You can find
some of the initial results of this work in my [Research Blog](/blog).

**I am currently looking for a PhD position in Generative Image Synthesis**, if
you are interested in my work and you would like to contact me, please do so
through any of the contacts at the bottom of this page. You can also find my CV
under the [CV](/cv) or learn more about my research interests and background
in the [About](/about) page.
