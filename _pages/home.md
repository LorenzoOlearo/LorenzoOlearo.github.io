Welcome to my personal website! I am Lorenzo Olearo, a student at the end of his
Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

Currently, under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi, I am working on my
thesis aimed at investigating the spatial behavior of Diffusion Models (DMs).
Are you interested in these topics and would like to know more about my work?
Check out my latest blog post on [Blending Diffusion
Models](/blog/2024/blending-diffusion-models/)!

My journey through this program has solidified my passion for academic research
and my desire to contribute to the field of Generative Image Synthesis. **I am
now looking for a PhD position in Generative Image Synthesis**, if you are
interested in my work and would like to contact me, please do so through any of
the contacts at the bottom of this page. You can also find my CV under the
[CV](/cv) or learn more about my research interests and background on the
[About](/about) page.
