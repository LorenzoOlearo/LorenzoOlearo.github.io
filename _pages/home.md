Welcome to my personal website! I am Lorenzo Olearo, a student at the end of his
Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

Currently under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi, I am working on my thesis
aimed at investigating the spatial behavior of Diffusion Models (DMs). Are you
interested in these topics and would like to know more about my work? Check out
my latest post on [Blending Diffusion Models](/blog/2024/blending-diffusion-models/)!

My journey through this program has solidified my passion for academic research
and my desire to contribute in the field of Generative Image Synthesis. **I am
currently looking for a PhD position in Generative Image Synthesis**, if you are
interested in my work and you would like to contact me, please do so through any
of the contacts at the bottom of this page. You can also find my CV under the
[CV](/cv) or learn more about my research interests and background in the
[About](/about) page.
